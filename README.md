# EECS 482 - General Coding Reference

Many students come into EECS 482 without a strong understanding of C++, code
compilation, debuggers, bash scripting, and other bits of pragmatic knowledge
that are extremely useful for a 482 student. This repo is meant to be
a reference for these students, to make the learning of these tools accessible
and practical while also working on their 482 projects.

## Repo Organization
Major topics are broken into subdirectories, each of which has its own README
file that acts as a "table of contents" for that directory.

- [C++ Programming](cpp/README.md) - General knowledge about programming in
  C/C++. Covers programming idioms, standard library facilities, code
  compilation, and so on.
