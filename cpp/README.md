## Topics

- [C++11 Smart Pointers](smart_ptr.md) - RAII-based wrappers around dynamically
  allocated pointers. These help to protect against memory leaks and offer
  other useful functionality, including reference counting.
- [Move Semantics](move_semantics/README.md) - The Big Three is a proper subset
  of the Big Five; move semantics encompasses the additional two operators.
